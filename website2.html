<p><strong>I believe that medical marijuana should be legalized in professional sports leagues because these athletes more than anyone need more medical choices that are not addictive pain killers as shown in a study from 2011 found players are roughly four times more likely than the rest of the population to be using painkillers.</strong></p>

<h3>Why marijuana should be legalized in sports.</h3>
<p> Many people including former professional athletes believe that Marijuana should be allowed at least medically in sports. <a href="#Bleacher-Report">Bleacher Report</a> a popular sports news platform has a podcast named "Smoked" about this topic. On this show former professional athletes talk about how although it was not and is not legal in most professional sports leagues such as the NBA, NFL, MLB, and many others it not only made their careers longer but also helped out multiple sports related injuries they suffered throughout many of their careers. Some other websites such as <a href="#Men's-Journal">Men's Journal</a> that weed can also help improve athletic recovery. The article also talks about how players smoking marijuana is not truly a problem within the fanbases as a recent Gallup poll indicicates that just about of 60% of americans support pot legalization. Also although not indicated on the study many more people would most likely be okay with it being legal in sports if it was for medical reasons.</p>
<h3>Why marijuana should not be legalized in sports.</h3>
<p> However there are still people who also believe sports should keep away from political issues such as marijuana being legalized. There are many reasons why people believe recreational and medical marijuana. Some studies show that marijuana can slow your reflexes and can make your muscles tired faster. Also some studies show that marijuana is a gateway drug, this means that if someone was to use marijuana then they are more likely to try other drugs as well. These are some popular opinions on this side of the argument and many other opinions like these are found on websites like the <a href=#Greatist">Greatist</a>.

<h3>Why medical marijuana should be allowed in sports.</h3>
<p>Some people understand opinions from both sides and these people believe that marijuana strictly for medical use would be professional sports best option to appease both sides of the opinion. These people believe this because medical marijuana takes all of the positives of marijuana use and since it would not be used more than necessary will not be taking in all the negative effects two. Since the medical marijuana would not be abuse less people would use it as a gateway drug. Also players would not use it enough to damage their lungs. Since it would be legalized the players would also gain all of the positve effects like a natural pain relieve and also less players would struggle with anxiety and depression.</p>
