<strong>Marijuana in Sports</strong>
<br>
<p><strong>I believe that marijuana should be legalized in professional sports leagues because these athletes more than anyone need more medical choices that are not addictive pain killers as shown in a study from 2011 found players are roughly four times more likely than the rest of the population to be using painkillers.</strong></p>
<br>

<div class="info">
<p> Many people including former professional athletes believe that Marijuana should be allowed at least medically in sports. Bleacher Report a popular sports news platform has a podcast named "Smoked" about this topic. On this show former professional athletes talk about how although it was not and is not legal in most professional sports leagues such as the NBA, NFL, MLB, and many others it not only made their careers longer but also helped out multiple sports related injuries they suffered throughout many of their careers. Some other websites such as Men's Journal that weed can also help improve athletic recovery. The article also talks about how players smoking marijuana is not truly a problem within the fanbases as a recent Gallup poll indicicates that just about of 60% of americans support pot legalization. Also although not indicated on the study many more people would most likely be okay with it being legal in sports if it was for medical reasons.</p>
